            The Canadian lynx is a cat of medium size with characteristic long ear tufts, a flared facial ruff, and a short,
            bobbed tail that has
            a completely black tip. Its paws are unusually large and in very deep snow act like snowshoes. Lynxes have thick
            fur and long legs,
            the hind legs being longer than the front legs, giving them a stooped appearance. Males are slightly bigger than
            females and there
            is not much geographic variation in size.

            <h3 class="content-text" >Habits and Lifestyle</h3>
            <p class="content-text">Canadian lynxes appear to be territorial and live solitary lives. Although the ranges of
                keep to distinct areas. Within male home ranges, there may be the range of several females and their young.
                Except during the breeding season in winter, adults generally avoid each other. Hunting mainly at night,
                these animals are
                primarily visual predators, however, they also have good hearing. 
            </p>
            
            <p id="div1" class="content-text">
                Females and their young sometimes hunt
                together when they
                spread out in a line and move through relatively open areas. In this way, prey flushed out by one individual
                is often caught by
                another in the line. This hunting method can work quite well and it may be important for educating the young
                about hunting
                techniques. Although mainly nocturnal, Canadian lynxes are sometimes active during the day. Their form of
                shelter is usually a
                rock ledge, under a group of fallen trees, or a shrub.
                females sometimes overlap, males.

            <p class="content-text">
                Native to North America, the Canadian lynx inhabits a range from the Arctic treeline,
                southwards through a good part of
                Alaska and Canada, as well as the north of the adjoining United States. It occurs predominantly in the dense
                boreal forest,
                and its range strongly coincides with that of the Snowshoe hare.

                <p id="div2" class="content-text">
                In the United States, the Canadian lynx
                occurs in the Blue
                Mountains, the Cascade Range and the southern Rocky Mountains, the Great Lakes region, and New England. The
                animal generally
                avoids open areas despite good prey availability and faces difficulty surviving in heavily logged areas and
                on agricultural land.

            <h3 class="content-text">Population</h3>
            <p class="content-text">
                In eastern Canada, the Canadian lynx is competing with the eastern coyote, which, over the last few decades, 
                and increased competition against other predators. Significant numbers of deaths are also due to rabies and distemper.
                has expanded its range. In the United States in the south, the main threats are habitat fragmentation and change, accidents, 
            </p>
            <p id="div3" class="content-text">
                A specialist predator, the Canada lynx depends heavily on snowshoe hares for food.
                Snowshoe hare populations in Alaska and central Canada undergo cyclic rises and falls—at times the population 
                densities can fall from as high as 2,300/km2 (6,000/sq mi) to as low as 12/km2 (31/sq mi). Consequently, 
                a period of hare scarcity occurs every eight to 11 years. An example of a prey-predator cycle, the cyclic 
                variations in snowshoe hare populations significantly affect the numbers of their predators—lynxes and 
                coyotes—in the region.
