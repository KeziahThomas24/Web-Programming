            Alpaca is a domesticated species of camelid. In fact, it is the
            smallest member of the camelid family, having a slim neck and body.
            Their heads, as well as the whole body, are slender while ears are,
            conversely, large and acuminate. Some alpacas have unicolorous wool,
            while others’ coat is varicolored, including about 22 colors: from
            black to white, from ginger to brown. Lower and upper incisors,
            along with lower canines, serve adult males as fighting teeth.

          Alpacas are social herd animals that live in family groups, consisting
          of a territorial alpha male, females, and their young ones. As a
          general rule, herds of alpacas are quite large, covering big
          territories. Alpha males, in turn, don’t refuse to render protection
          to a number of females and their young, taking them into the herd.
          However, once another male comes and overpowers the alpha male, he
          will straightway become the leader of the herd. And here’s where males
          start to rival, which brings serious fights. These rivalries are
          usually accompanied by shrilly and harsh noises, made by alpha males,
          having the purpose of warning each other as well as scaring away other
          alpha males from the herd. The period of alpacas’ highest activity is
          sunrise and sunset. Especially the young: usually, at this time of day
          one can observe playful behavior and increased activity of youngsters.
          Alpacas warn the herd about intruders by making sharp, noisy
          inhalations that sound like high-pitched bray. The herd may attack
          smaller predators with their front feet and can spit and kick. Alpacas
          can sometimes be aggressive, but they can also be very gentle,
          intelligent, and extremely observant.

          Domestication of Alpacas began 5.000 years ago. However, their
          popularity is only nowadays becoming internationally acknowledged.
          Alpacas played a crucial role in Inca civilization and culture. Inca
          civilization originates from Andes Mountains in Latin America, where
          alpacas have always been highly valued. However, during the Spanish
          conquest of the region, alpacas became threatened with total
          extermination. Fortunately, they miraculously survived thanks to their
          key role and importance to inhabitants of the Andes and amazing
          ability to endure harsh temperature extremes, unlike all other
          domestic animals.

        <h2>FUN FACT ONE</h2>
        <p class="paragraph secound_text" style="width: 90%">
          Alpaca wool is waterproof. Moreover, it can absorb moisture due to its
          surprising ability to simulate cotton in moisture recovery. Thanks to
          this, alpacas easily endure sharp temperature drops, their coat
          feeling lighter than wool while warmer than cotton.

          <h2>FUN FACT TWO</h2>
        <p class="paragraph secound_text" style="width: 90%">
          Generally, there are two types of alpacas. These are suri alpacas and
          huacaya alpacas. Suri alpacas are covered with fiber that overgrows to
          the form of dreadlocks. On the other hand, huacaya alpacas are covered
          with a shaggy, bushy, and waved coat, just like a teddy bear. Huacyas
          make up 90% of all alpacas in North America.

        <p class="paragraph secound_text" style="width: 90%">
          Llamas and alpacas are easily interbred, generating a species called
          huarizo.

          <h2>FUN FACT FOUR</h2>
        <p class="paragraph secound_text" style="width: 90%">
          Buzzing or humming sound is what you can usually hear from alpacas.
          It’s a kind of musical crooning. For alpacas, humming can serve as a
          signal of danger, curiosity, satisfaction, anxiety, fright, distress,
          or just boredom.

          As known, camels spit when they are angry or irritated while alpacas,
          being distant relatives of camels, do the same when upset.
