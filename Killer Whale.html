        The Killer whale or orca is one of the toothed whales and the largest member of the dolphin family. <br>
        They have long, round bodies with big dorsal fins in the middle of their back. <br>
        Their bodies are black with white patches underneath and near their eyes. <br>
        These distinctive patterns help to camouflage them when they are searching for food. <br>
        In newborns, the white parts of their body have an orange tinge.

            <h1>Habits and Lifestyle</h1>
            <p>
              Killer whales are highly social animals; they are active during the day and sleep at night. They travel in pods of between 3 and 50 individuals, led by females. They establish social hierarchies. Individuals in pods are usually related to each other and consist of about 20% adult males, 20% calves, with the rest being females and young males. They have limited dispersal from their maternal pod. Killer whales may share prey and seldom leave the pod for longer than a few hours. Pod members learn skills through apprenticeships, such as hunting and parenting. Killer whales are very vocal animals and communicate with each other using whistles and clicks via echolocation, and through physical behavior such as breaching, slapping their tail or flippers, and ‘spyhopping’, when they lift their head above the water.

            <h1>Diet and Nutrition</h1>
            <p>
              Killer whales are predators at the top of the food chain and prey upon a wide range of large prey including seals, smaller whales and dolphins, sea lions, different fish, sharks, squid, octopi, sea birds, and sea turtles, sea otters, and river otters.

            <h1>Population</h1>
            <h2>Population Numbers</h2>
            <p>
              According to the IUCN Red List, the worldwide population of the Killer whale is estimated to be around 50,000 whales. This species is currently classified as Data Deficient (DD) on the IUCN list of threatened species.
            </p>
            <h2>Population Threats</h2>
            <p>
              The greatest threat to these whales comes from degradation and disturbance of their habitat. Being at the top of the food chain, the Killer whale is vulnerable to contaminants accumulating in its tissues, such as the high levels of PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) found in some populations, with potentially negative impacts on its reproduction and survival. Extensive oil spills can affect these animals, either directly or indirectly, in that it reduces the number of their prey. Disturbance by boats and other underwater noises caused by humans can affect their behavior, disrupt social calls and echolocation, and impact the ability of Killer whales to effectively forage in places where whale-watching is increasingly popular. Boat traffic also increases the risk of injuries from collisions.

            <ul>
              <li>
                Killer whales don't typically attack humans, but they have this name because of their ability to take down large animals, such as other whales and sea lions. They will prey on nearly any animal in the sea, in the air above them, or along the coastline.
              </li>
              <li>
                Romans gave these whales the name "orca" and it has become popular over the years.
              </li>
              <li>
                When orcas are born, they have a flexible dorsal fin, which stiffens as they grow older.
              </li>
              <li>
                In the 1960s orcas made their enormous debut splash in marine shows.
              </li>
              <li>
                The most popular movies that have featured Killer whales include Happy Feet, Free Willy, and Namu: The Killer whale.
              </li>
              <li>
                These whales have a brain that is the second largest of all marine mammals and is second to only the sperm whale which has the largest brain out of any living animal.
