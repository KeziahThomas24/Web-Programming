        Arctic hare is a species of hare, living in cold Arctic regions. <br>
        These hares look like rabbits but have shorter ears, are taller when standing, and, unlike rabbits, can thrive in extreme cold. <br>
        Their front and hind legs are large and fluffy. <br>
        The color of the coat depends on the season of the year, while the fur on the underbelly and chest always remains gray. <br>
        Thus, in winters the fur grows long. <br>
        It becomes white, thicker, softer by feeling with black bunches on the edges of their ears. <br>
        Molting coincides with the summer season, during which the fur becomes brownish-grey to gray-blue. <br>
        Face, feet, ears, shoulders, legs, and, finally, back: molt one by one. <br>
        Males usually start molting after females.

            <h1>Location in Canada</h1>
            <p>
              The Arctic hare is distributed over the northernmost regions of the Canadian Arctic islands and Northern Canada, including Ellesmere Island, and farther south in Labrador and Newfoundland.

            <h1>Habits and Lifestyle</h1>
            <p>
              Arctic hares are nocturnal animals that prefer leading solitary lifestyles. However, to survive under extreme, Arctic weather conditions, hares congregate in groups. Here they get warm with each other’s bodies. Also, they feed in groups of 10-60 individuals in each one, though in far north regions they gather in large groups of up to 300 individuals. Feeling danger, a hare rises on its hind legs while keeping its front legs lifted and close to the chest. They stand still in this position, listening carefully to any rustling around. They can also hop away in this position. These hares are excellent swimmers and, as all hares, elusive runners. They dig through snow to get food.

            <h1>Diet and Nutrition</h1>
            <p>
              Arctic hares are herbivores (folivores), meaning that they mainly feed on plants. However, they enjoy eating willows and flowers as well. Due to the lack of suitable food in northernmost regions, these animals dig through the snowpack to get lichens, plants, and mosses. Their diet includes also rare leaves, buds, and roots of plants.

            <h1>Population</h1>
            <h2>Population Numbers</h2>
            <p>
              The population number of Arctic hare is not officially estimated. However, this widespread species is evidently not endangered, assuming that IUCN has classified the Arctic Hare in the IUCN Red List as Least Concern.
            </p>
            <h2>Population Threats</h2>
            <p>
              Major threats for Arctic hare are habitat loss in areas, overlapping with human settlements, and excessive hunting. As for the latter, they attract hunters for their pelts as well as meat. The majority of the hunters are indigenous people of the region. Moreover, in the case of global warming threats are likely to increase.
            </p>
            <h2>Ecological Niche</h2>
            <p>
              Arctic hares are important dispersers of seeds and an important food source for local predators.

            <ul>
              <li>
                In spite of frequently being called Arctic rabbit, this animal is a species of hare, not a rabbit. Differences are physiological, behavioral, and external. Thus, its ears are shorter and tidier than rabbits’; when it stands on its hind legs, it’s taller than a rabbit; and finally, it’s used to extremely low temperatures of the Polar Region.
              </li>
              <li>
                Hares’ eyelashes are black, thus protecting its eyes from bright light.
              </li>
              <li>
                Thanks to its eyes structure, a hare is able to see 360 degrees around, without moving its head.
              </li>
              <li>
                Comparably small ears of hares are a fine example of adapting to the environment, explained by the fact, that smaller ears waste less heat.
              </li>
              <li>
                Arctic hares are able to move at a speed of up to 40 miles/hour, the length of their jump reaching 6.8 feet.
