          The Arctic fox is a small fox well adapted to living in cold
          environments of Arctic regions. <br>
          It has a deep thick fur which is white in winter and brown in summer.
          <br>
          The Arctic fox can stay warm in winter not just because of its thick
          coat <br>
          but because of its generally rounded body shape with short legs, bushy
          tail, small rounded ears, and short muzzle.

            <h1>Habits and Lifestyle</h1>
            <p>
              Arctic foxes are diurnal animals. They live in a family consisting
              of one adult male, the young, and two vixens - one a non-breeding
              female born the year before that helps look after the next litter.
              Arctic foxes live in dens which they make far beneath the surface of
              the ground. Their dens have a number of entrances and have been
              lived in by generations of foxes for centuries. Arctic foxes survive
              harsh winters and food scarcity by either hoarding food or storing
              body fat. To locate prey during winter, the fox uses its sense of
              smell and hearing to find animals moving through tunnels underneath
              the snow. Arctic foxes are nomadic animals. During the winter, 95.5%
              of Arctic foxes utilize commuting trips, which remain within the
              fox's home range. Commuting trips in Arctic foxes last less than 3
              days and occur between 0-2.9 times a month.

            <h1>Diet and Nutrition</h1>
            <p>
            Arctic foxes are omnivores and scavengers. They will eat almost any
            animal, dead or alive. They prefer small mammals but will eat
            berries, insects, carrion, and even animal or human stools. In
            winter they usually eat sea mammals and birds, invertebrates, fish,
            and seals.

            <h1>Population</h1>
            <h2>Population Numbers</h2>
            <p>
              According to IUCN Red List, the world population of Arctic foxes is
              in the order of several hundred thousand animals. The Arctic fox is
              common in the tundra areas of Russia, Canada, coastal Alaska,
              Greenland, and Iceland. Despite legal protection, the adult
              population in Norway, Sweden, and Finland is estimated to be fewer
              than 200 individuals, so it is acutely endangered. Overall,
              currently, Arctic foxes are classified as Least Conern (LC) and
              their numbers today remain stable.
            </p>
            <h2>Population Threats</h2>
            <p>
              Arctic foxes are threatened by the fur trade and diseases caught
              from domestic dogs. Climate change is another threat, as the
              snow-line shrinks further and further north, reducing the range of
              the arctic fox and giving way to the red fox, advancing northward.
            </p>
            <h2>Ecological Niche</h2>
            <p>
              The Arctic fox helps to keep the environment clean by keeping the
              rodent population down and by eating dead animals.

            <h1 style="font-family: 'Permanent Marker', cursive">Fun Facts</h1>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Sometimes an Arctic fox will walk behind a polar bear to eat its
                food scraps.
              </li>
              <li>
                When cold, the fox will wrap its thick bushy tail around itself to
                keep warm.
              </li>
              <li>
                It has a unique heat exchange system that will stop it from
                shivering until the temperature goes below &#45;70 °C ( &#45;94
                °F).
              </li>
              <li>
                Arctic foxes that live where the color of the snow is not pure
                white grow fur with the same grayish color.
              </li>
              <li>
                When hunting, the fox must break through thick snow. To do this,
                the fox jumps up high and then dives headfirst into the snow.
              </li>
              <li>
                Arctic foxes have a keen sense of smell. They can smell carcasses
                that are often left by polar bears anywhere from 10-40 km (6-24
                miles). It is possible that they use their sense of smell to also
                track down polar bears. Additionally, Arctic foxes can smell and
                find frozen lemmings under 46-77 cm of snow and can detect a
                subnivean seal lair under 150 cm of snow.
              </li>
              <li>
                Arctic foxes have strongly pigmented eyes as protection from the
                glare of the sun. Sometimes each eye is a different color.
              </li>
              <li>
                The Arctic fox can easily hear lemmings burrowing under 4-5 inches
                (10-12 cm) of snow. When it has located its prey, the fox pounces,
                and punches through the snow to catch its prey.
              </li>
